    <p>Humans have vastly exploited the environment to sustain their own needs, often forgetting the ecological balance needed to sustain the biodiversity.</p>
    <p><b><a href="http://www.footprintnetwork.org/documents/2016_Living_Planet_Report_Summary_Lo.pdf" target="blank">Living Report Planet 2016</a></b>, published by WWF, proposes an idea which was first coined in the&nbsp;mid-1970s. It calls for a shift from the Holocene period - the era of Human Civilization to a new geological period called the "Anthropocene".<b> Anthropocene will be described as a period of significant human impact on our climate, forcing rapid changes in the environment</b>. Oceans are becoming acidic and entire biomes from temperate rainforests to coral reefs are disappearing. These magnitudes&nbsp;of impact suggests that there will be a sixth mass extinction on Earth.<b> All the previous five mass extinction took place in a period ranging from a few hundred thousand to millions of years, but Anthropocene will be with the fastest change over a very short period of time. This will be the first time the reason for mass extinction will be the activities of mankind.</b><br>

    <p><b>Since 1970, the wildlife population has declined by an average of 58% and is expected to reach around 67% at the end of this decade</b>. WWF's, <b><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?direction=desc&sort=extinction_status" target="blank">endangered animals list </a></b>categorises animals on a ranger of factors that include range size, population size and threats. This is how they are classified:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Critically endangered</b> &ndash; Extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.</li>
    <li><b>Endangered</b> &ndash; High risk of extinction in the wild.</li>
    <li><b>Vulnerable</b> &ndash; High risk of endangerment in the wild.</li>
    <li><b>Near threatened</b> &ndash; Likely to become endangered in the near future.</li>
    <li><b>Least concern</b> &ndash; Lowest risk. Does not qualify for a more at-risk category. Widespread and abundant taxa are included in this category.</li>
    </ul>
